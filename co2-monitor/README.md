## CO2 Monitor Usage

Co2 levels have a high impact on your decision making ability.
According to science, having 1000 ppm (parts per million, the standard unit of measuring co2 levels) already decreases decision making moderately, and 2500 ppm decreases it significantly. You'll be suprised how quickly the co2 levels rise in a closed room, reaching numbers way above 1000 ppm.
