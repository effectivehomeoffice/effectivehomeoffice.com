## Setup Zoom for Effective Screen Sharing

We use [zoom.us](https://zoom.us/) for all-day video conferences and screen sharing while doing [Remote Mob Programming](https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/).

# Enable Global Shortcuts

Make starting and stopping screen sharing as smooth as possible.

Enable system-wide short cuts in your desktop application.
