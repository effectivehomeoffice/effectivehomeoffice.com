# Effective Home Office

An opinionated guide to effectively work from home.

In our talks and articles about working from home, [we](#authors) get frequently asked about the hardware and software we use. We want to provide our tips for a successful setup to work from home.

Ask us anything on Twitter with hashtag [#effectivehomeoffice](https://twitter.com/hashtag/effectivehomeoffice).

## Hardware

### Microphone

As working from home has a higher natural communication barrier, invest in good hardware to improve the remote communication experience.
Audio is more important than video. 

Buy a podcaster microphone, as it has directed antenna and noise-cancelling capabilities.
This enables you to talk headset-free.

Our recommendation is the [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/) ($129). Set it to cardioid mode. Consider a [Compass boom arm](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/compass/) ($99) for perfect positioning.

### Headset

Don't use a headset, if you can.

In an environment where you need a headset (2+ people in the same room), you might consider a [Jabra Evolve](https://www.jabra.com.de/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve) headset, that matches your wearing preferences. Many prefer the [Evolve 65](https://www.jabra.com.de/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve/jabra-evolve-65).

For occasional calls, the [Apple AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/) are just fine.

### Webcam

The camera  itself is not super important. 
A decent webcam is sufficient. 
Nobody needs 4K. 
60fps is a nice-to-have. 
We use a [Logitech C922](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam) ($79).

More important is the position of the webcam.
Make sure to look directly to each other in video conferences.
You should put the webcam on top of your primary screen.
The webcam should be on eye-level (or slightly above).

Don't use your laptop's built-in camera.
It is mounted too low.


### Computer monitor

Currently, there is no display available that we can recommend.

Our requirements:

- _27" to 30" diagonal_. Not to small and not to big. Your workspace should fit on one full-screen.
- _No ultra-wide_. Use a popular aspect ratio, so others can see your full screen when screen sharing.
- _4K resolution_. 4K is required for screen sharing, as the screen may be fitted or zoomed to your screen. 4K helps here a lot. 5K or more is not recommended, as others might have problems to display it correctly. 
- _Webcam built-in_. As stated below, the webcam should be as close to the main screen as possible. So it should be built-in and horizontally centered. 
- _Good speakers_. The voices of your communication partners should come from the direction of the video stream. Crystal clear. 2 Watt speakers are not.
- _Accurate colors_. Not super important for most work. Colors should be OK.
- _Height-adjustable_. For ergonomics.
- _Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C_. State-of-the-art connectivity. We would love to finally get rid of our Thunderbolt docks.
- _Thin margins_. Design matters.

As already stated, unfortunately none of current displays match these requirements. 
We bought cheap 4K IPS displays and a Thunderbolt Dock, external Webcam, and use the MacBook speakers. 
Please give us a hint, if you have better alternatives.

We have different opinions about the usage of a second screen.
So, we won't give any recommendations here.


### Wi-Fi

Avoid Wi-Fi, if you can. 
Connection disruptions are annoying for everyone. 

Use a simple [Cat 7 ethernet cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Network-Ethernet-Patch-Cable/dp/B013PUMX8I) to connect your computer to your router.
This provides a reliable and fast connection.

If you cannot use an ethernet cable, evaluate [Power-line communication](https://en.avm.de/products/fritzpowerline/fritzpowerline-1240e-wlan-set/), which is still more reliable than Wi-Fi.

If you need better Wi-Fi, we recommend Ubiquiti [Unifi](https://unifi-network.ui.com/) and [Amplifi](https://amplifi.com/).

### iPad

### Desk

Make sure that your desk is at the perfect height.
It should not jiggle when moving the mouse or bumping the leg of the table.

We recommend a timeless and robust [USM Haller Desk](https://www.usm.com/en/residential/products/usm-haller-collection/usm-haller-tables-and-desks/) ($1000).

### Office Chair

Ergonomic seating and beautiful design, fully customizable: [Vitra Pacific Chair](https://www.vitra.com/en-ch/office/product/details/pacific-chair) ($900).
