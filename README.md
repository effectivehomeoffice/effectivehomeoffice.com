# Effective Home Office

An [opinionated](#why-opinionated) guide to effectively work from home.

![Effective Home Office](images/header.jpeg)

In our talks and articles about working from home, [we](#authors) get frequently asked about the hardware and software we use. We want to provide our tips for a successful setup to work from home, being it tips on hardware, software, methods, or, the most important aspect, health. Happy reading!

Feel free to reach out to us on Twitter with hashtag [#effectivehomeoffice](https://twitter.com/hashtag/effectivehomeoffice) or via email at [hello@effectivehomeoffice.com](mailto:hello@effectivehomeoffice.com) for questions, comments, praise, or critique.

## Microphone

Nobody wants to wear a headset all day.
Sadly, common integrated headset-free solutions in phones and notebooks let every listener suffer from bad audio and lots of noise.
To have happy listeners instead, get a podcaster microphone with directed antenna and noise-cancelling capabilities.
We recommend the [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/) ($129). Set it to cardioid mode.

## Headset

Don't use a headset. If you really have to, get the [Jabra Evolve 65](https://www.jabra.com/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve/jabra-evolve-65) ($180), or any other of the [Jabra Evolve](https://www.jabra.com/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve) family that fits your wearing preferences. For occasional calls the [Apple AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/) are just fine.

## Webcam

Make sure to look directly to each other in video conferences.
For that, the webcam must be on eye-level (or slightly above).
This rules out your laptop's built-in camera as it's mounted too low.
Instead, get an external webcam and mount in on top of your primary screen.
We use a [Logitech C922](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam) ($79).

## Monitor

Don't work primarily on your notebook monitor for ergonomic reasons (also see [Webcam](#webcam)). 
Get an external 27" 4K display. 
Scale your content as it's easier on the eyes.
No ultra-wide or 5K -- it's not worth it because it makes sharing your screen harder (resolutions don't match well)!
We would love to see a webcam built-in, good speakers and Thunderbolt 3 in a beautiful design.
Unfortunately none of currently available monitors matches these requirements. 
So, we bought [EIZO EV2785 ($1000), a good 4K IPS display](https://www.eizoglobal.com/products/flexscan/ev2785/index.html), and we're quite happy with it.

## Wi-Fi

Connection disruptions are annoying for everyone.
For a reliable and fast connection, use a [Cat 7 ethernet cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Network-Ethernet-Patch-Cable/dp/B013PUMX8I) to connect your computer to your router.
If you have to resort to Wi-Fi, invest, for the sake of your team, in high quality access points.
We recommend Ubiquiti [Unifi](https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-pro/) and [Amplifi](https://amplifi.com/amplifi-hd).

## Video Conferences

Use [zoom.us](https://zoom.us/) for video conferences and screen sharing. 
It's the most mature, stable, and less CPU-intense video conferencing that we know and has good support for Linux and mobile devices.
We can't live without the moveable video stream gallery overlay anymore, especially while screen sharing.

## Virtual Team Room

A virtual team room is like a video conference that's always available -- you can come and go anytime.
Zoom doesn't support the concept of a virtual team room directly, [but there's a workaround](/setup-zoom-as-virtual-team-room).
Make sure that your team room is for your team only, and any meetings with other teams happen in separate, dedicated virtual meeting rooms.

## Team API

TBD: async comm
Working from home changes communication structures: The bar for informal discussions with others is higher. 
Use topic specific chat rooms with [Slack](https://slack.com/) or [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-US/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software/), in which everyone can get answers uncomplicatedly and informally.
Communication is asynchronously and does not interupt one's flow.
Disable notifications.
Knowledge is shared company-wide, as interested colleagues read along.

We recommend these types of channels:

- Domain topic channels to discuss domain specific issues across all involved teams
- Public team channel as an interface for others to your team
- Private team-only channel to discuss internal or sensitive subjects
- Fun and small talk channel to keep other channels clutter-free


## Collaborative Whiteboard

We miss to scribble and discuss together on a real whiteboard.
There is no good alternative for distributed teams.
What comes next is [Miro](https://miro.com/) on an [iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) with an [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) to draw. One shares the Miro board in Zoom, so that everyone has focus on the same section of the board.

## Pairing

[Tuple](https://tuple.app/) (macOS only) seems very promising for remote pairing. It's the self-declared successor of the missed screenhero. We can't wait to try it out and share our experiences here.

## Full-Team Collaboration

We love [Remote Mob Programming](https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/).
The whole team works together on the same thing, at the same time, in the same virtual space.
Regardless of the term *programming*, these methods are suitable for any kind of knowledge work.
This is how we fight social isolation and being super productive in terms of time-to-market.
We developed the little tool [mob](https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/mob) for a smooth handover via git -- and we use it happily everyday.

## Office Chair

Ergonomic seating and beautiful design, fully customizable: [Vitra Pacific Chair](https://www.vitra.com/en-ch/office/product/details/pacific-chair) ($900).

## Desk

Make sure that your desk is at the perfect height.
It should not jiggle when moving the mouse or bumping the leg of the table.

Jochen likes the timeless and robust [USM Haller Desk](https://www.usm.com/en/residential/products/usm-haller-collection/usm-haller-tables-and-desks/) ($1000).

## CO2 meter

You'd be suprised how quickly the oxygen in a small room runs low, affecting your mental capacity.
The solution is simple: open your windows.
Thing is, your body realizes bad air quality too late -- your mental capacity is already reduced at that point.
So be proactive, and measure the co2 levels in your room so your brain stays happy.
We recommend a simple [co2 sensor with a warning light when to open your windows](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00TH3OW4Q/).

## Breaks

Have breaks away from keyboard! It's tempting to check emails or read stuff online during a short break, but we recommend to really take your breaks seriously and walk away from your home office, get a cup of coffee or go for a short walk. It really makes a difference! And for lunch, take your time to cook a good meal. Don't rush it to get back to work faster -- it's not worth it in the long run.

## Lighting and Green Screen

We heard that, to step up the game of video streaming, giving trainings or workshops online, [Soft Lights](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/key-light) and [Green Screen](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/green-screen) is the way to go. 
We already ordered them and will give feedback here. 
Stay tuned!

## Further Guides

[Remote: Office Not Required, by David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried](https://basecamp.com/books/remote) is a great starting point for ideas on making the switch to remote. It covers a wide range of topics, including recruiting.

[Remote Guide, by Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/) is a complete and very extensive collection on how to build a fully remote company, touching every aspect of that. It's basically the playbook of Gitlab itself, and is constantly improved from their own learnings.

## Why Opinionated

Instead of providing yet another long list of tools, this guide contains a short, curated selection of things that worked well for us working from home during the last years.
Everything is our own and honest opinion, and reflects our preferences, dislikes, and priorities.
But as we all know, everybody is different. 
So follow this guide with caution. Still, we do hope you can find one or two things that improves your work from home experience!
