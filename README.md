## Hardware

### Microphone

As working from home has higher natural communication barrier, invest in good hardware to improve the remote communication experience.
Audio is more important than video. 

Buy a podcaster microphone, as it has directed antenna and noise-cancelling capabilities.
This enables you to talk headset-free.

Our recommendation is the [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/) ($129). Switch it to cardioid mode. Consider a [Compass boom arm](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/compass/) ($99) for perfect positioning.

### Headset

Don't use a headset, if you can.

In a environment where you need a headset (2 persons in the same room), you might consider a [Jabra Evolve](https://www.jabra.com.de/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve) headset, that matches your preferences.
